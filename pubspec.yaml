# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub get
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
  
  # background_image: "assets/background.png"
  
  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  image: assets/images/visuals/splash_logo.png

  # Android-specific image (larger to prevent pixelation)
  image_android: assets/images/visuals/splash_logo_android.png

  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen.
  # It must be a png file. It is supported for Android, iOS and the Web.  For Android 12,
  # see the Android 12 section below.
  #branding: assets/dart.png

  # To position the branding image at the bottom of the screen you can use bottom, bottomRight,
  # and bottomLeft. The default values is bottom if not specified or specified something else.
  #branding_mode: bottom

  # The color property allows you to specify a color for the background of your splash screen.
  # The value provided must be a valid RGB hex color.
  color: "#7171FF"  # primair4Lilac - primary color
  
  # Optional parameters are listed below.  To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The color_dark property allows you to specify a different color for the background of your
  # splash screen when device is in dark mode. The value provided must be a valid RGB hex color.
  color_dark: "#121212"  # secundair1Deepblack - deep black background

  # The image_dark property allows you to specify a different image for the splash screen when
  # device is in dark mode. Using same white transparent logo for both modes.
  image_dark: assets/images/visuals/splash_logo.png

  # The android, ios and web parameters can be used to disable the splash screen on a per
  # platform basis.  If a parameter is not specified, the platform will be enabled.
  android: true
  ios: true
  web: false

  # Platform specific images can be specified with the following parameters, which will override
  # the respective parameter. You may specify all, selected, or none of these parameters:
  #color_android: "#42a5f5"
  #color_dark_android: "#042a49"
  #color_ios: "#42a5f5"
  #color_dark_ios: "#042a49"
  #image_android: assets/splash-android.png
  #image_dark_android: assets/splash-android-dark.png
  #image_ios: assets/splash-ios.png
  #image_dark_ios: assets/splash-ios-dark.png
  #color_web: "#42a5f5"
  #color_dark_web: "#042a49"
  #image_web: assets/splash-web.png
  #image_dark_web: assets/splash-web-dark.png

  # The position of the splash image can be set with android_gravity, ios_content_mode, and
  # web_image_mode parameters.  All default to center.
  #
  # android_gravity can be one of the following Android Gravity (see
  # https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Gravity): bottom, center, 
  # center_horizontal, center_vertical, clip_horizontal, clip_vertical, end, fill, fill_horizontal,
  # fill_vertical, left, right, start, or top.
  #android_gravity: center
  #
  # ios_content_mode can be one of the following iOS UIView.ContentMode (see 
  # https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/contentmode): scaleToFill, 
  # scaleAspectFit, scaleAspectFill, center, top, bottom, left, right, topLeft, topRight, 
  # bottomLeft, or bottomRight.
  #ios_content_mode: center
  #
  # web_image_mode can be one of the following modes: center, contain, stretch, and cover.
  #web_image_mode: center

  # To hide the notification bar, use the fullscreen parameter.  Has no effect in web since web 
  # has no notification bar.  Defaults to false.
  # NOTE: Unlike Android, iOS will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads.
  #       To show the notification bar, add the following code to your Flutter app:
  #       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  #       SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays([SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top]);
  fullscreen: true
  
  # Additional settings to prevent white screen flashing
  # These help ensure immediate splash screen display
  android_gravity: center
  ios_content_mode: center
  
  # Android 12 splash screen support
  android_12:
    # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
    # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
    # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
    # App icon with an icon background: This should be 240×240dp with a maximum radius of 108dp.
    # App icon without an icon background: This should be 288×288dp, or 144dp radius.
    image: assets/images/visuals/splash_logo_android.png
